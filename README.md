# IoT-Project-BLDG-Arduino

Script written in arduino board language in order to get information about the Blue Light exposition and send it to WiPy board through a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection.

Definition of a trigger every 2 second for acquisition of sensor data and transmission over BLE. 

Use of RGB sensor TSC34725 and extrapolation of Blue component. Better performances using a photodiode (not easily reachable).
